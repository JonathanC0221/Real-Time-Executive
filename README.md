# Real-Time-Executive

Developed a Real-Time Executive (RTX) for the ARM Cortex-M4 capable of preemptive multitasking and dynamic memory management. RTX supports dynamic task prioritization, deadline-based scheduling, inter-task priority management, and efficient context switching. Memory management is implemented using a first-fit allocation scheme, enabling allocation, deallocation, ownership tracking, and external fragmentation calculations.
